# My-Portfolio

# Description

This is my submission for the First draft of my portfolio. I will be making adjustments to it as the bootcamp goes along.

# Usage

I can use this portfolio to show prospective employers regarding my skills I have gained from the bootcamp, while also providing examples of projects I have created because of those skills.
